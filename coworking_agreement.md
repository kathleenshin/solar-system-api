# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*
- We both need internet, laptops and use of additional monitor if available.

## Collaboration vs. individual work expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations- does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*
- We will be working together in person during class time. 
- If we end up splitting work, make sure we understand what each of us is working on so that we can use that information for our own work.
- Pair programming style: driver, navigator
  
## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*
- Selene: discussing project instructions in full sets a good foundation for me. Discussing our path of building our code prior to starting. I appreciate sharing/exchanging efficiencies that could be applied to what we're working on. Sometimes I also need time to fully understand what we've learned in class and how we'll be applying to our project. I enjoy tracing data structures and processes for clarity (hooray for white boards!).
- Kathleen: Need time to process instructions. Would like to practice talking code outloud in progress and once complete to discuss alternatives. If approaching a problem I don't understand, discussing with the team member so they can help me understand or we can learn together. Also would be great to celebrate small/big wins!

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
- Selene: For coding feedback: directly is ok; passively may completely go over my head and I may not interpret it the same as it was meant to be. I would prefer the use of examples or comparisons, for example, "in this case we wouldn't want to xyz, because *input feedback*" For personal feedback: I understand I statements well, for example, "when you had xyz, I felt..." This would help me understand what I had done that cause something. I'd love to accomodate as much as possible!
- Kathleen: If I'm navigating and the other team member immediately knows a more efficient way to do something, give me the time to figure out/work out my ideas, and once complete, give feedback. If I'm doing/saying something that makes you uncomfortable, please let me know. If I ask for feedback, please feel free to be direct! Sandwich method for feedback works great, too: positive, constructive criticism, positive.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
-Kathleen: asking for help when needed, feeling more comfortable with expressing my thoughts more clearly, not being passive.
- Selene: checking in/provide updates often, at least once per collaborating session so we are aware of where we're at and can provide support or encourage asking for help.
- Team Skill to Improve: being more proactive about checking in.

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
- We can tryadopting the habit of adding problem solving comments, so it is more inviting for feedback
- Give ourselves 15-20 minutes if stuck on a problem before asking for help.
- Direct messages via Slack at anytime is OK
